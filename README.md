# CSC1810 Practice Programs

## single_star

In this program, you'll animate a single asterisk causing it to bounce back and forth from column zero to some column (currently defined as 40).

You'll learn:

* how to force output to happen even before a new line character
* how to overwrite a line on the console (rather than
advancing to a new line)
* how to delay your program's executation for a short while (for timing purposes)
* usage of `cinttypes` which makes the specific flavor of an integer unambiguous

### Specification for single star

Write a program that animates a single asterisk like this:

![star](./single_star.gif)

Don't worry about the program terminating - just kill it when you're done looking at it.

### Source code

DO NOT LOOK AT [THIS](./single_star.cpp) UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED TO WRITE THE CODE YOURSELF!
