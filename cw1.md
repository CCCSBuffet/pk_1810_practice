# Problem 1 from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com)

Inspired by a `kata` on codewars.com...

Write a program that prompts for a string. If the string is "quit", exit the program. Otherwise split the string into a vector of strings each containing two letters. If there are an odd number of characters in the string, return the last character joined with '_'.

## Sample output

```text
pkivolowitz@jekyl pk_1810_practice % ./a.out
Enter a string (or "quit"): mhutaq
mh
ut
aq
Enter a string (or "quit"): mi7bq
mi
7b
q_
Enter a string (or "quit"): quit
pkivolowitz@jekyl pk_1810_practice %
```

## Source code

The source code is [here](./pairs.cpp), but you should try to write this yourself.
