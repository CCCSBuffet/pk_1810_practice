	is a bit more advanced. You'll do just fine sticking with args1.cpp.

	Suppose the program is called by: prog one two three

	argv is an array in memory that looks like this:

	address of "prog"
	address of "one"
	address of "two"
	address of "three"
	zero (or nullptr)

	Given this example, can you work out the rest?
